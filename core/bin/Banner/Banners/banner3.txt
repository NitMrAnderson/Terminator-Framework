 Some good tips for users:
  1) To add your banner just add .txt file into the /usr/Banners directory
  2) To add plugin in the terminator framework just copy dir with your plugin into the /core/bin directory
  3) To use web interface run serve -w and follow to http://localhost:1235/skynet (Doesn't work yet)
 Happy hacking!
